            connection
            with
            it. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before you may sign in and start
            using
            the
            Services. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination of your account. You
            must
            immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security. We will
            not be
            liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts
            or
            omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you
            have
            violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation
            and
            goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We
            may

            the
            foregoing, on some occasions and in certain circumstances, with absolutely no obligation, we may be able to
            restore
            some or all of your data that has been deleted as of a certain date and time when we may have backed up data
            for

        <h2 id="limitation-of-liability">Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will CIAT, its affiliates, directors,
            officers,
            employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for any indirect, incidental, special,

            limitations
            and exclusions also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its
            essential
            purpose.</p>
