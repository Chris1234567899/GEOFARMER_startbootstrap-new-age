        <p>
            This Privacy Notice ("GDPR notice") describes how we obtain, processes and shares Personal Data on GeoFarmer
            Application and its derivates MyGeoFarm, GeoFarm Facilitator, MyGeoTree Nursery, and MyGeoTree Collector
            ("Apps"), developed by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture – CIAT ("Company"). By using the

        <h4>
            Introduction
        </h4>
        <p>
            While we do not frequently process Personal Data of individuals residing in the European Union (EU), the
            European Economic Area (EEA), or the United Kingdom (UK), we are steadfast in our commitment to safeguarding
            privacy and ensuring that all personal data is treated with utmost care and in strict accordance with the
            General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
        </p>
        <h4>
            GDPR and Research
        </h4>

        <p>
            It's important to note that GDPR is not intended to hinder research efforts; rather, it acknowledges the
            value
            of research and extends certain privileges in this regard. GDPR recognizes that all forms of data can
            contribute
            to valuable research and acknowledges the long-term nature of research endeavors. Consequently, research
            activities are granted exemptions from certain purpose and storage limitations, provided that they adhere to
            other data protection principles and incorporate specific safeguards.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Our Commitment
        </h4>
        <p>

            While recognizing the research exemptions within GDPR, we want to assure you that our approach to data
            processing is fully aligned with the principles of legality, fairness, and transparency. We are dedicated to
            ensuring that the processing of data remains lawful, fair, and transparent at all times.
        </p>
        <h4>

        </h4>

        <p>
            We are transparent about the data we collect, how it's used, and the measures we take to safeguard it. The
            information we may collect includes, but is not limited to, location data, agricultural preferences, device
            information, and usage analytics. This data helps us enhance the functionality of the GeoFarmer app and
            deliver
            a tailored research experience.
        </p>
        <h4>

            GeoFarmer app (see Terms of Use – GeoFarmer). You have the right to withdraw this consent at any time. If
            you
            choose to do so, please be aware that it may impact the functionality and effectiveness of the app.

            anonymized
            and aggregated data with research partners, industry collaborators, or regulatory bodies for the purpose of
